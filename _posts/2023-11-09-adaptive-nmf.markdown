**Abstract**:

Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)-based algorithms have been shown to be highly effective for detecting anomalies and identifying isotopes in gamma-ray spectra. However, the conventional implementation of these approaches requires the lengthy pre-computation of various algorithm components. This represents a potential barrier to widespread adoption for real-time use in the field. We propose a new NMF-based algorithm which adapts to changing conditions such as the underlying background model, energy calibration, integration time, and detection thresholds without user intervention. The algorithm includes computational improvements to conventional NMF and a novel method for filtering spectral anomalies, enabling real-time analysis of data. This paper will discuss the use of NMF for radiological detection, and the necessity of an adaptive approach, and describe our algorithm and its performance.
