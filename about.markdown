I have been a Scientific Engineering Associate with the Applied Nuclear Physics Program at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory since July 2022. My work focuses primarily on the design and implementation of interpretable algorithms for the purposes of modeling gamma-ray radiation background signatures, detecting potential external sources of radiation, and identifying the radionuclides present in the environment. 

I am seeking PhD positions in Computer Science. My research interests include
- Explainable artificial intelligence/machine learning (XAI)
- The mathematical foundations of machine learning
- Machine learning for science (e.g. applications in physics, biology, climate science)

I attended UC Berkeley from 2016 to 2020 where I majored in Applied Mathematics with a concentration in computer science. As an undergraduate I was fortunate to have an internship at the Advanced Light Source at Berkeley Lab in the summer of 2017. I also tutored linear algebra, calculus, and real analysis at the UC Berkeley Student Learning Center for 2 years.

Between 2020 and 2022 I worked as a Machine Learning Scientist for butlr.io. There I developed computer vision algorithms for low-resolution thermal images. I implemented a vision transformer (ViT) neural network for object detection and a ViT-based GAN for the generation of customizable and realistic data points.

In my spare time I enjoy making music, hiking, and watching college football (Go Bears!).
