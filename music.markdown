I have played guitar since I was 9 years old and have been writing and recording original music since I was 14. Currently I play guitar in [The Revelator][https://open.spotify.com/artist/6w1fuAeAxwKWocPmiTfWQI?si=7-elOSujQGyRuRDvxSR4SA] and [Cornelia][https://open.spotify.com/artist/3iXFfkoXV0cIF8qD8hkIQd?si=5omnLBDbSPe51tEeuC3-iQ]. I also write my own music which you can find on [Bandcamp][https://acjones.bandcamp.com/], [Spotify][https://open.spotify.com/artist/6CzMTY7JbnR09IbsIoI3rj?si=Watb3Oe5QbaLIQseWbBgsg], or wherever else you stream your music!
