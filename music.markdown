I have played guitar since I was 9 years old and have been writing and recording original music since I was 14. Currently I play guitar in [The Revelator](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6w1fuAeAxwKWocPmiTfWQI?si=7-elOSujQGyRuRDvxSR4SA) and [Cornelia](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3iXFfkoXV0cIF8qD8hkIQd?si=5omnLBDbSPe51tEeuC3-iQ). I also write my own music which you can find on [Bandcamp](https://acjones.bandcamp.com/), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6CzMTY7JbnR09IbsIoI3rj?si=Watb3Oe5QbaLIQseWbBgsg), or wherever else you stream your music!
